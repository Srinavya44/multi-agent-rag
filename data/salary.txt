# SALARY EXPLAINER (INDIA)

## Key definitions
- Cost to Company (CTC) = Fixed pay + Employer contributions + Variable pay if any.
- Gross monthly = Sum of monthly earnings before employee deductions.
- In-hand (take-home) = Gross monthly minus employee deductions such as PF, TDS, and Professional Tax.
- Employer contributions appear in CTC but are not paid in-hand.

## Typical components (earnings)
- Basic Pay: Fixed core component; usually 35–50% of CTC.
- House Rent Allowance (HRA): Commonly 40–50% of Basic depending on policy.
- Special/Other Allowances: Remaining portion of CTC structure.
- Bonus/Statutory Bonus: As per company policy or statutory rules; may be monthly or annual.

## Deductions (employee-side)
- Employee PF: Typically 12% of Basic if PF applies.
- Income Tax / TDS: Based on taxable income and regime (Old vs New).
- Professional Tax (PT): State-specific deduction where applicable.
- Other deductions: Insurance premium share, loans, meal cards, etc.

## Employer contributions (in CTC, not in-hand)
- Employer PF: Commonly 12% of Basic.
- Important: Employer PF is part of CTC but NOT part of in-hand (take-home). It is deposited to the Provident Fund account.
- Gratuity or other employer-paid benefits may be included in CTC but not paid in-hand.

## Simple formulas
- Employee PF (monthly) = 0.12 × Basic.
- Gross monthly = Basic + HRA + Allowances + Bonus (if paid monthly).
- In-hand ≈ Gross monthly − (Employee PF + TDS + PT + other deductions).
- Annual CTC = (12 × Gross monthly) + Employer contributions + Annual bonuses.

## Glossary
- Basic: Core fixed pay, base for PF and HRA.
- HRA: House Rent Allowance; may be partly tax-exempt.
- Special Allowance: Flexible component balancing the CTC.
- PF: Provident Fund; both employer and employee may contribute.
- TDS: Tax deducted at source on salary.
- Professional Tax: State-levied employment tax.
